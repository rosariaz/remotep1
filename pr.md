Overall, I thought the format of the website was really beautiful! I loved the pictures you chose, the different layouts for each page, and the professional animation styles that were used. I think our projects differed greatly in terms of what we focused on in the different pages. For my page, whenever I had text, I made it fairly large and different colored. I don't necessarily think one is better than the other in terms of user-experience, but I think the emphasis we had we just different. I will say that on some of the pages with black text, it does get drowned out a bit in the very vibrant and beautiful background which could be something to consider. I think both codebases are super maintainable because we have similar layouts for our photos, text, etc.

I think the files are well-structured and looking through the code was much simplier with the different directories that you created.

The one issue I found that's not a big deal is that with smaller screen sizes the navbar text gets a little compressed, but to some degree you can't really control it when the navbars get incredibly small. Besides that, I thought the website was well put together, and it handled user input very professionally! I think it was a great job. I looked in the CSS as well and found very little duplication due to your code structure which allowed me to see what you were doing so much easier!

Long story short, I really liked your website! :)
